## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Report privately

Send security reports to: security@lms-education-system.com

Or create a private security advisory on GitHub:
1. Go to our GitHub repository
2. Click on "Security" tab
3. Click "Report a vulnerability"
4. Fill out the form with details

### 3. Include in your report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Status Update**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (see below)

## Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection leading to data breach
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to admin

### High (Fix within 1 week)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Broken access control

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Insecure direct object references

### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Security misconfigurations
- Weak cryptography
- Missing security headers

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Backend Security
- ✅ Always validate input data
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- ✅ Implement proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Hash passwords with bcrypt
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Validate JWT tokens properly

#### Frontend Security
- ✅ Sanitize user inputs
- ✅ Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage
- ✅ Implement proper CORS headers
- ✅ Validate data received from APIs
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all requests

#### Database Security
- ✅ Use strong database passwords
- ✅ Limit database user privileges
- ✅ Enable database logging
- ✅ Regular security updates
- ✅ Backup encryption

### For Deployment

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production secrets - Never commit these!
JWT_SECRET=use-strong-random-secret-here
DB_PASSWORD=secure-database-password
ENCRYPTION_KEY=random-32-character-key
```

#### Security Headers
```javascript
// Express.js security middleware
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
  },
}));
```

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Session timeout
- ✅ 2FA support (planned)

### Data Protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Data encryption at rest (planned)

### Network Security
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Security headers (Helmet.js)
- ✅ IP whitelisting (admin features)

### Monitoring & Logging
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Failed login attempt tracking
- ✅ Audit trail for admin actions
- ✅ Real-time security monitoring (planned)
